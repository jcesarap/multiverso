# Pending
- Some kind of snapshot feature to handle merge conflicts through it, and not through intricate commands, which fine tune but add complexity - which is unacceptable here.
- Main branch is pending from design and morphography

# Stack
Use React with Material Components
https://mui.com/material-ui/

# Logic
- `git init`
    - if not git dir, then
- `git add .`
    - if no commit, add, then commit
- `git commit -am "$message"`
    - ...the above
- `git branch`
- `git branch (branch name)`

# Paced
* GitHub Integration
